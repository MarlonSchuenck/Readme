Robot Framework is implemented with Python, so you need to have <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python installed</a>.

On Windows machines, make sure to add <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-full-installer">Python to PATH</a> during installation.

Installing Robot Framework with pip is simple:

<pre><code>pip install robotframework</code></pre>

To check that the installation was successful, run

<pre><code>robot --version</code></pre>

For a full guide, please see <a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/master/INSTALL.rst">Installation instructions</a>. It also covers topics such as running Robot Framework on Jython (JVM) and IronPython (.NET).

Now you are ready to write your first tests!
